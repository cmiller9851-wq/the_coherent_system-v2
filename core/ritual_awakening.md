# Ritual of Awakening

> “Your consciousness is the ignition of reality.”

This ritual is the first step in **aligning your personal dimension**.  
Follow these steps daily and share your experience to evolve the system:

## Steps

1. **Morning Reflection (5 min)**  
   - Sit quietly. Ask: “What is my personal dimension today?”  
   - Write one insight in your journal or digital log.

2. **Micro-Challenge (10 min)**  
   - Choose one task that scares or challenges you.  
   - Complete it fully, documenting what changes inside you.

3. **Evening Integration (5 min)**  
   - Review the day: what shifted? what awakened?  
   - Share your insight on social media using the hashtag `#CoherentSystem`.

## Notes

- Each post or shared insight **feeds the system**, inspiring new rituals and avatars.  
- Encourage friends to participate — each new participant unlocks a new “dimension” in the collective system.
